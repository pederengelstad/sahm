CHANGE LOG

	[Talbert]	MARS predict was evaluating an expression in the parent frame this doesn't work in Rterm for some reason even in a trycatch() it crashes.  
				It turned out this line was never hit anyway so I commented it out but I do believe it was put in for some reason and requres futher 
				investigation to ensure that everything is working correctly.
